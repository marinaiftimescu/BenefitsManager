# BenefitsManager

-Team project with 5 members( We all worked on both: the front end and the backend tasks)

-We had to create an application to simplify the management through which the company offers a package of benefits that an employee can enjoy.
-The admin can manage (add/edit/delete) employers, benefit packages, can add the receipts that the employee brings to be settled according to the budget allocated for that type of benefit in the current quarter.
-The employee can add the receipts, view the packages and choose one for the current quarter after logging in successfully.
-The budget for some benefit packages is fixed and for another the budget can be accumulated from a quarter to another.
-If the admin delete a package, the employers will be notify.
